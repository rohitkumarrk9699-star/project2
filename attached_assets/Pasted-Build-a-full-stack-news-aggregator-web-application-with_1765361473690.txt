Build a full-stack news aggregator web application with live web scraping. The backend should have an API endpoint that scrapes 20 trending articles per category (International, Sports, Technology, Health, Science) from real news websites using Cheerio and Axios. Each article must include: title, 2-page detailed content, unique image URL from the source, source name, and clickable source link. No database - all data is scraped fresh on every request. The frontend should be a modern, responsive React app with category pages, article cards showing source attribution, and detailed article pages with "Read Original Source" buttons. Use Tailwind CSS for styling with a clean editorial design. Every page refresh should trigger new scraping with no caching. 📋 Complete Project Specification: LiveBuzz - Live News Aggregator Project Overview A fully responsive, full-stack blog web application that performs live web scraping to fetch the top 20 latest/trending news items from multiple categories.
